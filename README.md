### ReactJS event-based application using Create React App in Asynchronous

Event-enabling APIs is a relatively recent phenomenon compared to event-driven architecture (EDA), 
and it uses EDA to support scalable, real-time (or near-real-time), push-based communication in APIs published to third parties. 
Being event-driven is about taking advantage of events as they happen, and consumers can register their interest (subscribe) 
and react to events in real-time. Making APIs event-driven or asynchronous (along with an underlying server-side event-driven architecture) 
can eliminate the need for inefficient polling requests and send updates to the client (event subscriber) as soon as they occur. 
This provides a much better experience for users.

A scalable microservices architecture (MSA) is the optimal architecture for complex event-driven backend services. 
These event-driven microservices can act as event subscribers or publishers in order to process events, handle errors, 
and persist event-driven states.
